# Testimonials
This is a project built with Vue3 and Nuxt3, using Tailwind CSS. The project showcases a grid component that displays clients' testimonials. By clicking on a card in the grid, users can view the details of a specific testimonial. Additionally, the project includes a form that allows users to submit their own testimonials.

The project was designed with modular components in mind, with an emphasis on managing data fetching and structure for convenience. The project also demonstrates how to communicate between components using props and emitting events, allowing for easier management of methods within specific components.

To get started with the project, simply clone the repository and run the following commands:
yarn install
yarn dev
